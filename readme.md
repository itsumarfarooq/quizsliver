# Quiz Sliver

COMSATS hybrid quizzes is the most fun part of whole university life. As everyone else, we also solved them in groups. We used to take screenshots of difficult MCQs and when they repeat from someone else we just check them to answer correctly. But being a clever mind I proceeded one step ahead and built a chrome extension that automatically save each MCQ you answer and when that MCQ is repeat it automatically mark the correct and and submit.

For a long period of time that was kept in my PC. Recently I randomly found in my PC and now I'm sharing it publicly. I don't know but may its already popular among the students, because I remember I shared it with some close friends.

## FAQs

### Is it legal?
**TLDR:** Most probably not.

But the point to ponder is we are not doing some illegal. I just automated the process that students even before me were doing. So this extension is as wrong as solving quizzes in groups in wrong.

### Which subjects are suported?
**TLDR:** Yes it support each and every subject.

I had frequently asked which subjects are supported by this extension. And the short answer is it support quizzes for all the subjects. But it has more data for RWS than other subjects, but if you use this extension the database will get stronger and will be helpful for the joniors.

## How to install??

Now how can you install it on your PC? Below are the steps you can follow:

1. Download the extension. Click on green "Clone or download" buttom above and Click "Download ZIP".
2. Extract that ZIP somewhere in you PC.
3. Open `chrome://extensions/` url in you Chrome browser.
4. Turn on Developer mode on top right corner.
5. Click newly came "Load Unpacked" button. And select the extracted folder.
6. Open the CUOnline and continue solving you quizzes.

## How to update??

Below are the steps you can follow to update the extension:

1. Remove the extension from `chrome://extensions/` url
2. Redownload the latest version from `https://github.com/itsumarfarooq/quizsliver`
3. Install it by following the steps described above.

## How much data we have?
The main thing that matters in not code but the MCQ's data the extension had. All the MCQs data is saved in a centralized database so if anyone ever had solved any MCQ at any time, you don't have to solve that again :).

Unfortunately, I never used the final version myself but As I shared it with my friends, I'm 100% sure that this will already be use by may students. Which means there should be a lot of data.
